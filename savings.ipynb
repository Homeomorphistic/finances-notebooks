    "We know that prices are going up with each year and we call this factor an inflation (let's denote it as $f$). If the prices are twice as much as last year, then $f=100\\%$. It affects your deposit, because you can buy twice less. What is the relation between your deposit and future worth of it? Let's say that we have $D_n$ deposit at $n$-th period, we can buy $m$ goods for a price of $c_n$ and the rate of inflation at this period is $f$, then:\n",
